- Added AssignedEmployeeID column to Tasks 
  - I'm just going to allow a task to be worked on by only 1 employee because we are considering tasks to small enough that only 1 employee should be responsible for
    it. We can change this if y'all really want to (allow task to be worked on by multiple employees), but I don't think it's really essential and only allowing 1 
    simplifies a lot of things.
- Deleted EndDate in Tasks (this is same thing as DateCompleted)
- Changed Title to TaskName in Tasks (more descriptive)
- Added unique key to Tasks for combo of PhaseID and currentPosition (tasks within same phase cannot have same postion)
- Added unique key to Tasks for combo of AssignedEmployeeID, ProjectID, and TaskName (tasks with same name cannot be assigned to same employee within same project.
  This would just be a duplicate. However, you can have two tasks with the same name within the same project as long as they are assigned to different people)

- Deleted Client and Employee Phones tables, and moved phone numbers into Client and Employee tables (she suggested that we do this)

- Added unique key to Phase for combo of ProjectID and currentPosition (phases within same project cannot have same position)
- Added unique key to Phase for combo of ProjectID and PhaseName (phases within same project cannot have same name)

- Removed ProjectID reference from Timesheet (this relationship will be covered in a new relationship table)
- Changed StartTime to StartDate in Timesheet and changed datatype from datetime to date (user will just be asked to insert hours, not a start time and end time)
- Removed EndDate from Timesheet (this won't be necessary anymore since each timesheet will always cover 1 week interval. In other words, EndDate is always 7 days
  after StartDate, so there's no reason to record it)

- Added Hours_Worked table (relationship table linking Timesheet and Project)
  - Records hours worked each day of a week by an employee on a specific project
  - TimesheetID is foreign key to Timesheet table. This tells you the StartDate and Employee that the hours relate to
  - ProjectID is foreign key to Project table. This tells you the project that the hours relate to
  - Added constraint that hours >= 0 for all days
  - We probably want to prevent users from inputting more than ~80-100 hours on a project per week because this is very unlikely and will heavily mess up
    our reports. I think I will enforce this on the UI or we should create a trigger for it or something.
  - Each day has default value 0 (no value can be null)

- Added unique key to Department for DepartmentName (don't allow 2 departments with the same name)
